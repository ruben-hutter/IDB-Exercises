## Task (Theory) 3: Questions

### Advantages of Databases:

*Data Integrity and Accuracy:* Database systems provide mechanisms such as constraints, validation rules, and relationships that ensure data is consistent, accurate, and reliable. For example, a relational database can prevent the creation of duplicate records or ensure that required fields are not left empty.

*Data Security:* With proper configuration, database systems offer robust security features. They can control who accesses the data, what kind of data they can access, and what actions they can perform on that data. This is vital for protecting sensitive or confidential information.

### Disadvantages:

*Complexity and Cost:* Setting up, maintaining, and optimizing a database system can be complex and requires expertise. This can lead to increased costs in terms of hiring skilled personnel, purchasing licenses (for proprietary systems), and investing in hardware and infrastructure.

*Performance Issues:* While databases are designed to be efficient, they can suffer from performance issues as data volume grows or as more complex operations are needed. This requires regular monitoring, tuning, and sometimes even hardware upgrades, which again can result in increased costs and maintenance efforts.
